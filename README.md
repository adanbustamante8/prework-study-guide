## Prework Study Guide

## Description
Here we have a study guide for bootcamp students to use and make it easier for them to understand some of the languages we learnt about.
My motivation to build this webpage was for it to be useful and straight forward with important notes for future students, I built this project for a couple reason the main one being to keep track of my progress and learning but also for other starting developers to be able to use it!
It contains imnportant notes on HTML,CSS,Git, and Javascript to faciliate the languages for me as well as other developers
